PROBLEM STATEMENT:

    Take the observations of avian habitat in Seward Peninsula, Alaska, and plot it visually to 
    better see the variation that exists (2012). The aim is to emphasize the variations and bring 
    out strong patterns across several sites. What variations exist and what will the patterns 
    look like? Let's find out.

NOTE:

    Some features were diliberately omitted in order to look specifically at habitat variety and richness.
    Specifically, 
    
        1. Site (Unique identifier for bird survey and habitat survey location),
        2. Observer, (Initials of primary observer),
        3. Subpoint, (Subsample identifier, 10-15 subsample plots associated with each site) and
        4. VOR (Visual Obstruction Reading assessed at 2 meters and 0.5 meters from ground)
    
    were omitted.
